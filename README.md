## Project Preview

Invoices are read from CSV, overdue entries are selected, reminder emails are sent through Zoho SMTP, all processed invoices are logged, and a daily PDF summary is generated.  
The tool supports dry-run mode for safe testing and includes modular helpers for CSV, logging, email, and reporting.
